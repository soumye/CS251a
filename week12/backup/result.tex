\subsection{Algebraic Explanation}
We now give an algebraic explanation as to why the above stated algorithm works. Consider these two digit numbers as $ab$ and $a(10-b)$. Note that the first common digit is a and the second digits are b and 10-b respectively.
\begin{align*}
    ab  \times  a(10-b) & = ( 10a + b )( 10a + 10 - b ) \\
                 & = 100a^2 + 100a -10a \times b + 10a \times b + 10 \times b - b^2 \\
                 & = 100a \times (a+1) + b \times (10-b) \\
                 & = a \times (a+1) \; | \; b \times (10-b) \\
\end{align*}

\subsection{Extension}
For general case we can assume the product of two n digit numbers whose first k digits are same such that $k < n$ and the rest of n-k digit is such that the sum for both numbers in $ {10}^{n-k} $. Then again the product will be the concatenation of product of number formed by first k digits and its successor and product of number formed by rest of the digit and its subtraction from $ {10}^{n-k} $

\subsection{Algebraic Explanation}
We now give an algebraic explanation as to why the above stated algorithm works. Consider these two digit numbers as $ab$ and $(10-a)b$. Note that the second common digit is b and the first digits are a and 10-a respectively.
\begin{align*}
    ab  \times  (10-a)b & = ( 10a + b )( 10(10 - a) + b ) \\
                 & = ( 10a + b )( 100 - 10a + b ) \\
                 & = 1000a - 100a^2 + 10a \times b + 100b - 10a \times b + b^2 \\
                 & = 100(10a - a^2 + b) + b^2 \\
                 & = 100(a(10 - a) + b) + b^2 \\
                 & = a(10 - a) + b \; | \; b^2 \\   
\end{align*}
\subsection{Extension}
For general case we can assume the product of two n digit numbers whose last k digits are same such that $k < n$ and the rest of n-k digit is such that the sum for both numbers in $ {10}^{n-k} $. Then again the product will be the concatenation of product of number formed by first k digits added with the last k digits and the square of number formed by rest of the digit.

\section{Why these Methods are Faster}
In regular multiplication of two 2-digit numbers we need to do 4 1-1 digit multiplications. But in this shorter method we need to only do 2 1-1 digit multiplications and 2 simple additions. This makes it less time consuming and efficient. Also since it takes only a short part of the working memory, so one is able to do it easily.
